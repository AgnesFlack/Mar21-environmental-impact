# Introduction 
During this DataDive, DataKind volunteers will explore the Assessment, Cleanup and Redevelopment Exchange System (ACRES), an online database for Brownfields Grantees to electronically submit data directly to EPA. Volunteers will explore this data alongside the 5-year American Community Survey (ACS) data in order to derive insights about the demographics and socioeconomic characteristics of counties affected by Brownfields cleanups.
