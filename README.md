# Introduction 
During this DataDive, DataKind volunteers will explore the Assessment, Cleanup and Redevelopment Exchange System (ACRES), an online database for Brownfields Grantees to electronically submit data directly to EPA. Volunteers will explore this data alongside the 5-year American Community Survey (ACS) data in order to derive insights about the demographics and socioeconomic characteristics of counties affected by Brownfields cleanups.

# Key Questions for the DataDive Event
1. Summarize and/or describe the cost of a brownfield cleanup:
  - By phase (Phase I Assessment, Phase II Assessment, Cleanup and Remediation)
  - By location
  - Over time
  - By demographics
  - By type of redevelopment site (see Question #5)
2. What benchmarks exist in the data; or, in other words, what does a “typical” cleanup look like? What do outliers look like?
3. What similar groupings, or clusters, exist in the ACRES dataset, particularly in relation to the cost of a cleanup?
4. What variables in the ACRES dataset are most predictive of the cost of a cleanup? Which can be excluded from the dataset entirely?
5. Using NLP techniques, what information can be gleaned about the type of property being cleaned up from the Description/History and Highlights fields?
6. How long does it take to complete a Phase I assessment? A Phase II assessment? A cleanup?
7. What proportion of cleanups reach the redevelopment phase? How long does redevelopment take, and what are typical costs?
